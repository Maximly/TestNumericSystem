# TestNumericSystem

Just an exotic numeric system for fun. 

Numbers are
XY-XY-XY-...-XY, where X are letters (A-Z, excluding some letters specified), Y are numbers (1-9, excluding some numbers specified)

Increment and init from const char* is implemented.

Interesting outcomes are possible if you add additional dependencies/rules between X and Y. Once a rule is derived from a key, your own encryption algorithm can be created.
